# xk6-influxdbv2 

This is a influxdb(v2) output library for [k6](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6),
implemented as an extension using the [xk6](https://github.com/grafana/xk6) system.

| :exclamation: This is a proof of concept, isn't supported by the k6 team, and may break in the future. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! |
|------|

The extension in this
current repo served as an example for an xk6 output tutorial,
but using one or the other is up to the user. :)
